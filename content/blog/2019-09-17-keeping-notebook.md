title: Keeping a Notebook
---

I recently came across this [note](https://notebook.lachlanjc.me/2019-09-06_keeping_a_notebook/) and I could agree to all of the reasons mentioned for creating a Notebook. So here it is - [/notebook](/notebook).

I have set my own format though, I'll keep the name of the note as the date, and I'll put multiple headings to separate the different topics I write about on each day. Some days I might not write anything due to whatever reason, but I will at least put the reason why I have not written, even if it is a single line.

Here's to hoping I am able to at least grow my writing habit using this Notebook.
