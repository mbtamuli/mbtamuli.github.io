It’s a humid evening here in Guwahati, and I realize—it’s been **five years** since I last wrote here.

A couple of months ago I watched 12th Fail, and a line stuck with me: don’t treat failures as final—just restart until you succeed. I’ve never been great at communicating, and I think writing might help me structure my thoughts—and maybe even speak better too.

The silence here didn’t mean my life was on pause. If anything, my interests have only grown wider. Whether it’s hiking through mountain passes, tinkering with servers, or trying to coax mushrooms into fruiting, I’ve found myself drawn again and again to systems — digital, natural, and personal.

Last year I trekked the Chandrakhani Pass — my first multi-day trek with tents and campfires. I met some amazing people, and I’m already planning the next one.

I also set up Tailscale to secure the servers I manage—hosting a Minecraft world, a Discord bot, and a few random web experiments. It was surprisingly smooth, and a great entry point into Zero Trust networking.

A couple of weeks ago, a friend introduced me to the world of growing mushrooms. I was instantly hooked—ordered a starter kit the same day. It’s far outside my comfort zone, but I think that’s exactly why it’ll be fun. I’ve also been back on Minecraft with friends. Running from baby zombies, patching creeper holes, and soaring with an elytra is the perfect break from daily chores.

The only way to keep writing is to start writing, so here we are. This is my restart—and I’d love for you to follow along.
