title: Route VPN Traffic
---

My personal laptop, my beloved Dell XPS 15, broke down. The SSD was not being detected. Fixing it would take time and I thought I'd get it fixed when I less workload.

Now as part of my work, I need to connect to a VPN. The VPN solution is [Palo Alto's GlobalProtect VPN](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/globalprotect) :sweat_smile: (I'll rant about GlobalProtect VPN some other time!). I can only connect to the VPN using my Dell XPS as it's MAC address was registered. I got another laptop lying around(ThinkPad E470), but the process to get this new laptop's MAC address registered would take around 2 weeks!

Using a ArchLinux LiveUSB, I was able to check that I could connect to the VPN from the XPS. Just that my SSD was not being detected. To get working quickly, I thought I could figure out a way to route the traffic from the ThinkPad laptop through the Dell XPS laptop(while it was connected to the VPN).

Using the `getent` command, on the Dell XPS, I got the IP address of the hosts I wanted to route using the VPN.

```bash
$ getent hosts git.example.com
172.17.1.174     git.example.com
```

I stored the entries in the `/etc/hosts` file on the ThinkPad laptop.

Also, had to make sure the Dell XPS laptop was able to forward traffic and setup iptables to do NAT.

```bash
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o gpd0 -j MASQUERADE
```

Now, to actually route the traffic.

```bash
$ sudo ip route add 172.17.1.174 via 192.168.31.60
```

In this command, the IP `172.17.1.174` is the IP that we want to be routed through the VPN. The IP `192.168.31.60` is the IP address of the Dell XPS. Since I already have the entry in the `/etc/hosts` file, I am done.

Browse to git.example.com, and voil√†. Everything works as expected! :smile:
