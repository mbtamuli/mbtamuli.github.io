## Hi, I'm Mriyam

I'm a Senior Software Engineer specializing in Platform Engineering with 7+ years of experience building products that help other engineers do their job better. Currently, my focus is on **Golang** and **Kubernetes**, creating cloud-native solutions that scale.

## What I Do

I work with various clients to provide cloud-native solutions with programmable infrastructure. My toolkit includes modern technologies like Docker, Helm, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, and Ansible. I've contributed to and led a team driving the development of [EasyEngine](https://easyengine.io/), an open source project that simplifies WordPress deployments.

## My Approach

Albert Einstein said (or maybe not) -
> The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.

I consider myself a tinkerer and problem solver with a strong attachment to Linux and a DIY mindset. I believe in learning by doing and solving real problems with practical solutions.

## Background & Experience

I've worn many hats throughout my career - platform engineer, web developer, system administrator, and team lead for open source projects. Sometimes I'm simply "the helpful guy," mentoring newer teammates or helping friends with technical challenges. This diverse background gives me a unique perspective on the full software development lifecycle, from writing code to deploying and maintaining systems in production.

## Beyond Work

My idea of a weekend project? 
- Building and flying a drone
- Hooking up a Raspberry Pi to integrate with my home electricals
- Setting up a Minecraft server for my friends and me to play.

I love hands-on projects that combine hardware and software.

## Let's Connect

If any of this sounds interesting and you'd like to chat about technology, open source, or potential collaboration, drop me an email at **contact** at **mriyam** dot **dev**.
