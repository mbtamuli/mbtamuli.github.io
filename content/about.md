I consider myself a tinkerer and problem solver. I have a strong attachment to Linux and DIY mindset. My idea of a weekend project would be building and flying a drone or fixing up a Raspberry Pi with my home electricals! I have worn many hats in the past and have worked as a web developer, a system administrator and a team lead for an open source project.

I am working as a Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience. Currently my focus in on **Golang** and **Kubernetes**. I have worked with various clients to provide cloud-native solutions with programmable infrastructure using modern tools - Docker, Helm, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible, etc. I have contributed to and also led a team to drive the work on an open source project, [EasyEngine](https://easyengine.io/).

If any of the above sounds interesting and you'd like to chat, drop an email at **contact** at **mriyam** dot **dev** or select a slot [**on my calendar**](https://calendar.x.ai/mriyam/virtual) to schedule a meeting.

Thanks for reading.
