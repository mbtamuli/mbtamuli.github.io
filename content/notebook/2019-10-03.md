# Things done today
Almost same as yesterday, I completed [day 4](https://github.com/mbtamuli/JavaScript30#day-4---october-3-2019) of the [#JavaScript30 challenge](https://javascript30.com/). I completed another chapter of EloquentJS.

So today we also started preparing for this event we're planning around [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). We're planning a local event here in Guwahati(my hometown and where I'm currently staying) where we'll guide first time open source contributors :tada: :confetti_ball: . We also have a page up [Hacktoberfest'19 Guwahati](http://bit.ly/hof-ghy) with the details.
