# Running node completely in Docker :whale:

I'm currently learning a few things about web development and although I am not learning NodeJS right now, I am using NodeJS to run and install stuff.

First of all, JavaScript. I'm focusing on vanilla JavaScript for now, but I am using the [delightful JavaScript Testing Framework Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Then while working on HTML and CSS, I like to use the package [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server), to disable cache so I don't have to keep the Dev Tools open always to be able to see the latest uncached content.

For this reason, I require Node and NPM installed on my laptop, but I like to keep things isolated. I do know about Node Version Managers but it's my personal setup, so I will do however I please!

So I used this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mbtamuli/dockerfiles/blob/master/node/Dockerfile) and a [few aliases](https://github.com/mbtamuli/dotfiles/blob/master/.zsh_aliases#L154-L162) to get all these commands to work directly from my host machine. :muscle:
```bash
yarn test
npm install http-server -g
http-server -c-1
```

# Automation FTW! :rocket:

After reading about [keeping dependencies up to date](https://github.blog/2019-01-31-keep-your-dependencies-secure-and-up-to-date-with-github-and-dependabot/) I had [enabled it](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-automated-security-fixes). Just yesterday I came across this [tweet](https://twitter.com/gabro27/status/1173547934132178944) and was happy to see even the merging part can be automated. For my personal blog, I can have this setup without giving two thoughts about it.
So I enabled [mergify](https://mergify.io) and added this [configuration](https://github.com/mbtamuli/mbtamuli.github.io/blob/master/.mergify.yml).

You can see the result in [this PR](https://github.com/mbtamuli/mbtamuli.github.io/pull/1). :sunglasses:
