# Things done today

Today, I kept on thinking mentally about distributing the time properly,
instead of getting stuck on one single issue. It feels good when things go
according to plan. Otherwise going down a rabbit hole and getting stuck makes
me feel bad later when I don't make any progress in the other things I planned
on doing.

So today I added all my tasks for today on [Kanbanflow](https://kanbanflow.com)
and then set the built in Pomodoro timer and followed it. Getting stuck in
a rabbit hole is something I do too often, and I can't pull myself back out in
time, so that I don't "waste" time.

# Daily coding

After getting stuck on one exercise for the whole day on
[20th](https://mriyam.dev/notebook/2019-09-20/#coding-exercises) I decided to
focus on the JavaScript parts of the exercise as I'm new to the syntax. I've
set the time as one Pomodoro(25mins), if I'm not able to complete one exercise
within one Pomodoro, I skip it. So I was able to do quite a lot of exercises
today and it helped me learn more of the syntax! (I actually learnt about
`Array.prototype.find()` today)

# Daily writing

I am feeling less of a block writing daily like this. The notes idea was
brilliant, thanks to whoever started it. Writing daily like this has made me
write more, in the same amount of time today that I dedicated on the first day
for writing a note.

# Near future todo

I plan to add a [Now page](https://sivers.org/nowff) soon. It's an interesting
idea and a thing I keep answering people a lot about when they ask the question
"What are you doing now?" / "What's going on in your life now?".

One more thing I see that I can add to my blog, would be a
[Uses page](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses). I could then showcase the
amazing customized Arch system I'm painstakingly building! :sweat_smile:
