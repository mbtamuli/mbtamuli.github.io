## Coding exercises

So I finished only one of the problems. Then I started the next problem and unabashedly spent the remaining scheduled time on it! :man_facepalming:. I read a few things on writing functional code in Javascript which is wildly fun! Functional programming, since being new for me is something I'm trying to wrap my head around and it's exciting!

## CSS layout

Nope, nada. Did nothing about it. :face_with_head_bandage:

## GitHub Action

I made some progress, mostly I did a lot of reading today. If you are just starting on GitHub Actions, I'd recommend to read these -
1. [Building actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/building-actions)
2. [Metadata syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)
3. [Development tools for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/development-tools-for-github-actions)
4. [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
5. [Contexts and expression syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Eloquent JS

I was able to read the first three chapters of the book and plan to continue tomorrow. :v:
