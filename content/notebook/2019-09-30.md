# Things done today
Today I got to know about [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), enrolled and also [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/mbtamuli/status/1178567102984118272) to hold myself accountable! :fire: :sunglasses:
I did the first day's challenge and it's live here - [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://mriyam.dev/JavaScript30/CompletedChallenges/01-js-drum-kit/)


Apart from this, I also setup the [Firicico font](https://github.com/kosimst/Firicico) for Visual Studio Code. I run VS Code in a Docker container(inspired by the awesome [@jessfraz](https://twitter.com/jessfraz/)). I updated the dockerfiles repo with the [VS Code setup](https://github.com/mbtamuli/dockerfiles/blob/master/vscode/Dockerfile#L62-L68)
