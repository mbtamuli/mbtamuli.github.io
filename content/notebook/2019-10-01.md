# Things done today
The Great Indian Festival sale is ongoing on Amazon and I had ordered the [Echo Dot (3rd Gen)](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07PFFMP9P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) along with a [Wipro WiFi Enabled Smart LED Bulb](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07PD4DW17/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I played around with it like a kid getting new toys for a good part of the morning. :sweat_smile: Well, that is setup properly and I can be lazier than before. :sunglasses:

Other than that, I completed another chapter of EloquentJS along with it's exercises. As for the [#JavaScript30 challenge](https://javascript30.com/), I completed [day 2](https://github.com/mbtamuli/JavaScript30#day-2---october-1-2019)

We're in the _endgame_ quarter of this year. I've just recently started my journey into Web Development and it has been a wild ride for the last couple of weeks. I hope to make the coming weeks even wilder and end the year on a good note with me being able to have a good grasp on JavaScript and a decent grasp of basic CSS. :crossed_fingers: :slightly_smiling_face:
