# Automation FTW again! :rocket:

I came across [this blog post](https://byparker.com/blog/2018/use-git-github-to-manage-your-dns-with-octodns/) by the current maintainer of Jekyll. I'm a big proponent of Infrastracture as Code and when I saw this easy to use tool, [Octodns](https://github.com/github/octodns), I got hooked. I saw that even the DNS for the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) is being maintained [using octodns](https://github.com/jekyll/dns)!

I just modified the config a little to make use of the latest YAML syntax, because the older syntax [is being deprecated](https://help.github.com/en/articles/migrating-github-actions-from-hcl-syntax-to-yaml-syntax#about-the-new-yaml-syntax-for-github-actions). Voil√†! [https://github.com/mbtamuli/dns](https://github.com/mbtamuli/dns).

I intend to make one improvement, adding the dry-run output of the testing phase, as a comment in the PR itself. That is for another day.
