1. [Thinkers vs Doers: Who Gives Better Advice?](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/09/23/thinkers-vs-doers/)


In this well written article by Scott I read today, he makes an important point
that made me take a step back and think hard. He claims that the people who are
good at something don't really remember their own success. The real reason for
their success or the actual guidelines they followed to take the decisions
that made them who they are. He mentions about Steve Jobs giving advice he
didn't follow himself, and how most of our _autobiographies_ are constantly
being rewritten to the point of being skewed.

I personally think that anything we read or hear should be taken with a grain
of salt. Otherwise we risk
[anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring).

# Daily Coding

I was not able to continue with the exercises today but I read a few things about
[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and set up a fork of dwm to modify it as
I like. [My personal fork](https://github.com/mbtamuli/dwm) currently contains
only two patches that I added to have the bare minimum(maybe a little less)
working environment. I'm going to be making more edits and pushing to this repo
over time.
