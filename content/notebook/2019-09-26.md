Also found this gem of a quote in [EloquentJS](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

> When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep. - Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand of Darkness

# Things done today

So I setup this tool - [Clight](https://github.com/FedeDP/Clight) to enable the
night mode effect on the screen. Basically does some gamma correction based on
the time of the day.

I also followed read the CSS parts of this tutorial [Learn to Code HTML
& CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-css/). Will be
trying on my own tomorrow.

# Daily coding

The exercises are helpful in that they're making me use more and more of the
available standard built-in objects and their methods. So for example, today
I learnt about the [`String.localeCompare`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare)
method while doing one of the coding exercises. Yesterday I learnt about the
[`Array.prototype.find`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) method.

Now on the reading part, I have to say, EloquentJS is really eloquent! :laughing:
This quote is really appropriate for the writing in the book.

> Talking and eloquence are not the same: to speak and to speak well are two things - Ben Jonson

Even if you know about variables, statements, expressions and other constructs
in a programming language, you will gain a different perspective reading the
EloquentJS book. You do actually need to read it to understand why I'm saying
this. The book is [available online](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
